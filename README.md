Adds a less-than-useless enchantment (curse) that replaces the use action with a twirl!<br/>
<i>I'll try spinning! That's a good trick!</i><br/>
</center>

---

Any twirling-enchanted item can be used to visually spin around!

This prevents utilizing the usual use for an item, like drawing a bow or tilling soil.

Books can be enchanted with twirling at a crafting table using feathers, wind charges, or breeze rods.

## Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others.

This mod was made for ModFest: Carnival!

We're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.
